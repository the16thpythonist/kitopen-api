# KITOpen publication listing API

## CHANGELOG

### 0.0.0.0 - 04.07.2018

- initial commit

### 0.0.0.1 - 10.07.2018

- Added the 'PHPUnit' module to the dev requirements
- Added simple API test
- Fixed bugs in the API class

### 0.0.0.2 - 10.07.2018

- Added a static method to the API class, which will return the URL to the specific page 
of a publication, if given the KIT Open id. (This is for the cases, where one only has the 
id, but doesnt want to request the whole publication over again, just to get the url)
